This means that the individual must demonstrate that they do not have any intention to immigrate or stay permanently in the United States.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a dual-intent visa allows the bearer to have both the intention to temporarily stay in the United States and the intention to potentially immigrate or stay permanently in the country. This means that individuals with a dual-intent visa can apply for entry to the United States in a certain nonimmigrant classification, such as a temporary worker or student, while also having the option to pursue permanent residency in the future.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the issuance of a visa does not guarantee entry into the United States. The Department of State is responsible for visa adjudication, while U.S. Customs and Border Protection immigration inspectors determine the admission, length of stay, and conditions of stay at a port of entry.\"   \n",

On the other hand, OPT is a temporary employment authorization program for F-1 students who have completed their degree programs in the U.S. OPT allows students to gain practical work experience in their field of study for a certain period of time after completing their studies.

For a 24-month STEM OPT extension, the Form I-765 must be received by USCIS during the 90-day period prior to the expiration of the post-completion OPT and within 60 days after the DSO enters the recommendation for STEM OPT into the SEVIS record. It is important to note that processing times can vary, so it is advisable to apply as early as possible to allow for any potential delays.\"   \n",
